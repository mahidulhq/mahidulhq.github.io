I am a CS student and active learner in the cybersecurity field, with hands-on involvement in **penetration testing, security, privacy and vulnerability exploration**. I regularly practice through CTF platforms including **Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and picoCTF**, treating them as training grounds rather than entertainment.

Alongside security, I am engaged in **competitive programming**, working toward a **1.5k CodeChef rating**(soon) with over **1,000 problems solved**(soon), sharpening algorithmic thinking and problem-solving discipline.

My technical toolkit includes:
**Languages:** HTML, CSS, C, C++, Python, Bash, Java, Go(soon).
**Core Areas:** privacy & security, open-source, technology exploration/ testing/ debugging, design systems.

I also bring professional experience in **UI/UX design, product design, SEO, and digital product strategy**, which gives me a practical understanding of how real systems are built, used, and often misconfigured.

Certifications from **Cisco, Google, Linux Foundation, Grameenphone, and Codecademy** support my formal training, but most of my growth comes from building, breaking, and analyzing real systems.

Open to collaboration, security research discussions, CTF teams, and opportunities that value curiosity, consistency, and practical skill development.
