      - text: |
          Computer Science student with a focused trajectory in cybersecurity, offensive security, and secure system design. Actively building expertise as a penetration tester and security consultant while strengthening foundations in programming, problem solving, and system-level thinking.

          My work sits at the intersection of **security, engineering, and design** — combining technical depth in software and infrastructure with a strong background in UI design and UX research. I approach technology not just as something to build, but something to **break, analyze, optimize, and secure**.

          This space documents what I learn, test, solve, and discover across cybersecurity, competitive programming, open-source tools, and system experimentation.

      - text: |
          I am a CS student and active learner in the cybersecurity domain, with hands-on involvement in **penetration testing, security research, and vulnerability exploration**. I regularly practice through CTF platforms including **Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and picoCTF**, treating them as training grounds rather than entertainment.
          Alongside security, I am deeply engaged in **competitive programming**, working toward a **1.5k CodeChef rating** with over **1,000 problems solved**, sharpening algorithmic thinking and problem-solving discipline.

          My technical toolkit includes:
          **Languages:** HTML, CSS, C, C++, Python, Bash
          **Core Areas:** Security testing, debugging, system exploration, design systems, and performance thinking

          I also bring professional experience in **UI/UX design, product design, SEO, and digital product strategy**, which gives me a practical understanding of how real systems are built, used, and often misconfigured.
          Certifications from **Cisco, Google, Linux Foundation, Grameenphone, and Codecademy** support my formal training, but most of my growth comes from building, breaking, and analyzing real systems.
