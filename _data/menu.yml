      # - text: 
      #     I am a CS student and active learner in the cybersecurity domain, with hands-on involvement in **penetration testing, security research, and vulnerability exploration**. I regularly practice through CTF platforms including **Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and picoCTF**, treating them as training grounds rather than entertainment.
      #     Alongside security, I am deeply engaged in **competitive programming**, working toward a **1.5k CodeChef rating** with over **1,000 problems solved**, sharpening algorithmic thinking and problem-solving discipline.

      #     My technical toolkit includes:
      #     **Languages:** HTML, CSS, C, C++, Python, Bash
      #     **Core Areas:** Security testing, debugging, system exploration, design systems, and performance thinking

      #     I also bring professional experience in **UI/UX design, product design, SEO, and digital product strategy**, which gives me a practical understanding of how real systems are built, used, and often misconfigured.
      #     Certifications from **Cisco, Google, Linux Foundation, Grameenphone, and Codecademy** support my formal training, but most of my growth comes from building, breaking, and analyzing real systems.
