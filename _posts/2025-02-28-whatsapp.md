Hackers can gain remote control of your phone by quietly downloading PDFs or APKs. They can gain complete access to your data by installing a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) on your device. Many users are not aware of this serious threat.

Student groups are one of the most popular ways hackers take advantage of this. These groups are a prime target for cybercriminals because they often share documents, especially PDF files.

A malicious file may be sent by a hacker, masked as a study guide, assignment, or notes.

While auto-download is turned on, the file is saved to the device without the user having to do anything. Once the phone is accessible, the hacker can access it, steal banking information, and even take over the entire device.

To be safe, turn off WhatsAppâ€™s auto-download feature by heading to settings, choosing Storage and Data, and turning off media auto-download for mobile data and Wi-Fi. Also, stay away from downloading materials from suspicious contacts or unknown groups. Other chat applications like Signal and Telegram, which also permit automatic media downloads by default, are subject to the same safety measures.

Message applications are a popular target for hackers, who are constantly searching for new methods to take advantage of unaware users. You can prevent being a victim of these assaults by being careful about what you download and changing your security settings. Remain alert and safeguard your mobile device from online threats.
