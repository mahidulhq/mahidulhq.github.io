If you have already started learning C, moving to C++ will feel familiar but it also opens up many more features. C++ was built on top of C, so many parts are the same. But C++ adds extra tools, especially for object-oriented programming.

In this blog, we’ll go over all the basic syntax of C++ and compare it with C. This is perfect for new learners who want to understand how C and C++ are similar and different.

# Header Files

In C:

In C++

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*V6oQSLYSq7WkMtgj2YNaFw.png)

In C, we use ```stdio.h``` for input/output.
In C++, we use ```iostream``` This is one of the first changes you’ll notice.

# Input and Output

C style (printf, scanf):

C++ style (cin, cout):

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*2TUrvvL-HW0ssZtSfMIzjg.png)

C++ uses ```cin``` and ```cout```, which are easier to read and write. No need for format specifiers like ```%d``` or ```%f```.

# Main Function

Both C and C++:

No major difference here. But in C++, you can use function overloading, which isn’t possible in C.

# Variables and Data Types

Same in both languages:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*c_2VKHfvyd4gqn-FBDaNFg.png)

In both languages, you declare variables with a type. But in C++, you can also use `bool` and `string` directly.

C++ adds:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*32wV1msFHUlRWgbXSb-c1A.png)

To use `string` in C++, you need to include:

# Conditionals and Loops

These are almost the same in C and C++:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Z4QwEd5FPTce_1ikAllz3Q.png)

Syntax for `if`, `while`, `for`, and `switch` is almost identical.

# Functions

In both languages:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*zrmdCR2KMhwBj7H0VeA-nw.png)

But in C++, you can overload a function:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*4qReaplyNoOHTjAZgNzKMg.png)

Also, C++ supports default arguments:

# Pointers and Memory

In C:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*OYxbxrpKrqoVMw8DTeVpuw.png)

C++:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*ibtF6rM9ktIqTaZ74KisGA.png)

Both support pointers, but the new/delete syntax in C++ is cleaner than malloc/free.

# Structures and Classes

C uses struct:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*e478A0IJfseQsJqJN6kI0w.png)

C++ uses class:

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*OLI_mjyuNF-wpZtzlV9Ouw.png)

This is where C++ gets powerful it supports object-oriented programming (OOP) using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

# Standard Template Library (STL)   C++ Only

C++ comes with built-in tools like vectors, maps, stacks, and algorithms.

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*0Ib5zdIbHno-ZlFIev_Dnw.png)

There’s nothing like this in C by default. You’d have to build it manually.

# Namespaces

C++ supports namespaces to avoid name conflicts.  

![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*jnETq8OD9EZSgJGf3du7HQ.png)

This lets you use `cout`, `cin`, and `string` directly, without writing `std::` every time. C doesn’t have namespaces.

If you’re just starting, learn the basics of both. Practice writing small programs in C++, and you’ll begin to notice how it makes your code more flexible and readable. Happy Coding!
