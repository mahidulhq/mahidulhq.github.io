How much math should i know? The answer is school level mathematics is enough to start and solve easy to medium level problem solving.
## Arithmetic Basics

- **Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)**: Loops, counters, scaling data; beware integer vs. float division (e.g., 5/2=2 vs 2.5).
    
- **Modulus (%)**: Remainders for even/odd (`n % 2`), cycles, hashing; your "even-mod" is too narrow.
    
- **Exponents/Powers (^ or **)**: Growth models, array sizing (e.g., 2^n for bit shifts); absent in your list, causes exponential bugs.
    
- **Absolute value (`|x|`)**: Distances, error metrics; trivial but frequently botched.
    

## Number Theory

- **Divisibility checks (n % k == 0)**: Factors, grouping; extend to GCD via Euclidean algorithm.
    
- **Prime/composite numbers**: Identify via trial division up to √n.
    
- **Divisor counting**: Sum divisors efficiently (O(√n)); blind loops timeout on large inputs.
    
- **Primality tests**: Basic trial division or Sieve of Eratosthenes for ranges; O(n log log n) beats your implied brute force.
    
- **Binary/Number systems (`base 2, octal, hex`)**: Bitwise ops (`& | ^ ~ >> <<`), masks, flags.
    

## Logic and Booleans 

- **Boolean logic (`AND &&, OR ||, NOT !, XOR`)**: Conditions, filters, state machines; no program runs without this.
    
- **Truth tables**: Evaluate expressions.

## Probability and Counting

- **Basic probability (events, odds)**: Simulations, randomness (e.g., `random()` seeds); define P(A) = favorable/total.
    
- **Combinations (C(n,k)), Permutations (P(n,k))**: Sampling, shuffling; off-by-1 errors kill naive factorials.
    

## Geometry and Coordinates

- **Coordinate systems (Cartesian x,y)**: Graphics, maps (e.g., distance = √((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²)).
    
- **Basic geometry**: Angles (radians for trig funcs), area/perimeter; vectors for direction (dx, dy).
    

## Algorithms Foundations 

- **Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)**: Expression evaluation; precedence bugs crash code.
    
- **Min/max, rounding (floor/ceil)**: Data bounds, normalization.
    
- **Sums/products (sigma notation basics)**: Accumulators, stats.
