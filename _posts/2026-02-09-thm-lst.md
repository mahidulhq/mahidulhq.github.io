***TASK 3:***  

1. Hypothetically, you find yourself in a directory with many files and want to move all these files to the directory of /home/francis/logs. What is the correct command to do this?  
Answer:  

```
mv * /home/francis/logs
```

mv -- -logs -newlogs
```

4. How would you copy the file named encryption keys to the directory of /home/john/logs

```
cp "encryption keys" /home/john/logs
```

5. Find a file named readME_hint.txt inside topson's directory and read it. Using the instructions it gives you, get the second flag.  

Use `find` for the file-  

```
find / -name readME_hint.txt 2>/dev/null
```

then read it with `cat`  
Answer:  

```
Flag{234@i4s87u5hbn$3}
```


***TASK 4:***  

1. Download the hash file attached to this task and attempt to crack the MD5 hash. What is the password?
2. 
After downloading the attached file-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1011.jpg) 
by using `hash-identifier` we can get the type of the hash. Here it's MD5. We can decrypt this with online tool like [iotools](https://iotools.cloud/tool/md5-decrypt/).

Answer:  

```
secret123
```

2. SSH as **sarah** using: sarah@[10.49.157.49] and use the password: **rainbowtree1230x**  What is the hash type stored in the file hashA.txt

after logged-in-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1012.jpg) 
We use `find` to find the file directory. We read the file using `cat` . using `hash-identifier` we found out the hash is 
`MD4`.
Answer:  `MD4`

3. Crack hashA.txt using john the ripper, what is the password?  

```bash
john --wordlist=/home/mucker/Downloads/rockyou.txt --format=Raw-MD4 hash.txt
```

Answer:    

```
admin
```

4. What is the hash type stored in the file hashB.txt
Use `hash-identifier`  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1010.jpg) 

Answer:  

```
SHA-1
```

5. Find a wordlist  with the file extention of '.mnf' and use it to crack the hash with the filename hashC.txt. What is the password?  

Well use `scp` to download the `.mnf` file to our VM machine

```bash
scp sarah@10.49.157.49:'/home/sarah/system AB/db/ww.mnf' .
```

then the file is in the machine, we'll use john to crack the password-  

```bash
john --wordlist=/home/mucker/ww.mnf --format=raw-sha1 hash.txt
```

Answer: `unacvaolipatnuggi`  

6. Crack hashB.txt using john the ripper, what is the password?  
First find the file `hashB.txt`  

```bash
find / -name hashB.txt 2>/dev/null
```

to crack it with John the ripper we'll use-  

```bash
john --wordlist=/home/mucker/Downloads/rockyou.txt --format=raw-sha1 hash.txt 
```

Answer:    
```
letmein
```

***TASK 5:***  

1. what is the name of the tool which allows us to decode base64 strings?
Answer:    
```
base64
```

2. find a file called encoded.txt. What is the special answer?
Use `find` to searching for the file-  

```bash
sarah@james:~$ find / -name encoded.txt 2>/dev/null
/home/sarah/system AB/managed/encoded.txt

sarah@james:~$ cd "/home/sarah/system AB/managed/"

sarah@james:~/system AB/managed$ ls
encoded.txt
```

now encode the file to a new file called `new.txt` -  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1009.jpg) 

after analyzing this encoded texts we found a hint- 

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1008.jpg) 

we have to look for `ent.txt` now-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1007.jpg) 

now lets check the hashes first  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1006.jpg) 

using john the ripper-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1005.jpg) 
Answer: `john`

***TASK 6:***  

1. You wish to encrypt a file called history_logs.txt using the AES-128 scheme. What is the full command to do this?  
Answer:    
```
gpg --cipher-algo AES-128 --symmetric history_logs.txt
```

2. What is the command to decrypt the file you just encrypted?  
Answer:    

```
gpg history_logs.txt.gpg
```


3. Find an encrypted file called layer4.txt, its password is bob. Use this to locate the flag. What is the flag?  

First look for the file using `find`  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1004.jpg) 

and continues the same process using `gpg`.  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1003.jpg) 

We decode this message using [base64](https://www.base64decode.org/) online tool.  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1001.jpg) 

and then  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1000.jpg) 
Flag: `Flag{B07$f854f5ghg4s37}`  

***TASK 7:***  

1. Find an encrypted file called personal.txt.gpg and find a wordlist called data.txt. Use tac to reverse the wordlist before brute-forcing it against the encrypted file. What is the password to the encrypted file?

ANSWER: `valamanezivonia`  

2. What is written in this now decrypted file?

ANSWER: `getting stronger in linux`  

***TASK 8:***  

1. Find a file called employees.sql and read the SQL database. (Sarah and Sameer can log both into mysql using the password: password). Find the flag contained in one of the tables. What is the flag?
Lets find the `employee.sql` file first-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1013.png)

then logged in to sql using given user and password-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1014.png)
source the employee file-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1015.png)
will take a few moment to load the database.
Then choosing a database to view-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1016.png)
Displaying the tables in the selected database-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1017.png)
Describing the table data structure-  

![image](/assets/images/screenshots/1018.png)

Displaying all the data stored in a specific table, we are looking for `Flag`-
