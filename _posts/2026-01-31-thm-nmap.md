This writeup only included practical part of the room.  

## **Does the target ip respond to ICMP echo (ping) requests (Y/N)?**

To know this-

```
sudo nmap -PE 10.48.131.33
```

100% packet loss or no response means NO.  
Answer: N  

## **Perform an Xmas scan on the first 999 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open or filtered?**

```bash

Answer: 999

## **There is a reason given for this -- what is it?**

**Note:** *The answer will be in your scan results. Think carefully about which switches to use -- and read the hint before asking for help!*

Answer: no response  

## **Perform a TCP SYN scan on the first 5000 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open?**

```bash
┌──(goblin㉿kali)-[~/Desktop]
└─$ sudo nmap -sS -p 1-5000 -vv -Pn 10.48.131.33
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times may be slower.

## **Open Wireshark (see [Cryillic's](https://tryhackme.com/p/Cryillic) [Wireshark Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/wireshark) for instructions) and perform a TCP Connect scan against port 80 on the target, monitoring the results. Make sure you understand what's going on. Deploy the `ftp-anon` script against the box. Can Nmap login successfully to the FTP server on port 21? (Y/N)**

```
root@ip-10-48-170-166:~# nmap -p 21 --script=ftp-anon 10.48.131.33
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-01-30 21:08 GMT
