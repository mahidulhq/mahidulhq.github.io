To connect OpenVPN or an `.ovpn` file on Kali Linux, install the package if needed and run the client with your config file it's straightforward via terminal. This assumes you have a valid .ovpn config from your VPN provider; without one, nothing works.

## Prerequisites

Kali Linux typically has OpenVPN preinstalled, but verify with `openvpn --version`. If missing, update and install: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install openvpn -y`. You'll need root privileges (use `sudo`) and your .ovpn file downloaded.

## Command-Line Method (CLI)

This is the most reliable approach on Kali, especially for headless setups.

- Navigate to your .ovpn file's directory: `cd /path/to/config/` example: `/home/username/Downloads/nordvpn.ovpn`
- Connect: `sudo openvpn your-config.ovpn` (replace with your filename, e.g., `sudo openvpn nordvpn.ovpn`).
- Enter credentials if prompted (username/password); keep the terminal open.
- Success shows "**Initialization Sequence Completed.**" Disconnect with Ctrl+C.
- Remember that while using the ovpn you have to keep the terminal open and running the process.

## GUI Method (NetworkManager)

Install plugins if not present: `sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome -y`, then reboot.

- Click the network icon (top-right), select "VPN Connections" > "Add a VPN Connection" > "Import from file...".
- Select your .ovpn; add credentials.
- Toggle the VPN on from the menu.

GUI adds convenience but risks misconfiguration and CLI is faster and less error-prone for Kali's security focus—prefer it unless you need persistence.
