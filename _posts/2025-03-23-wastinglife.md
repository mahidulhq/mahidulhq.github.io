## Step-by-Step: Breaking the Cycle

1. Cut Down Screen Time  
Your phone is not your best friend it’s your biggest distraction. If you’re spending hours scrolling, you’re feeding the loop. Start by reducing unnecessary screen time set app limits, turn off notifications, or just keep your phone away when working or studying.

2. Fix Your Sleep Schedule  
6 hours of sleep? That’s the bare minimum. If you want a brain boost and upgrades, aim for 8+ hours consistently. Try it for a few days, and you’ll feel the difference. More sleep = more focus + more energy + better decisions.

3. Rebuild Your Focus  
If you find yourself constantly distracted, it’s time to fix your focus. Start small work in short bursts, use the Pomodoro technique, or just sit down and work without touching your phone. The more you practice, the stronger your focus will get.

4. Stay Hydrated  
This one’s simple 3 liters of water per day for guys, 2.7 liters for girls. Your brain needs water to function properly. Dehydration = low energy + bad focus + mood swings. Fix it.

5. Lose the Extra Fat  
Physical health and mental health go hand in hand. If you’re carrying extra weight, it might be slowing you down physically and mentally. Start small walk, work out, or just eat better. A stronger body = a stronger mind.

6. Identify What’s Manipulating You  
What’s controlling your mind?

- Games?
- Social media?
- Porn?
- Music?

Figure it out. Slowly start reducing whatever keeps you stuck. You don’t need to quit everything overnight, but you do need to take control.

7. Keep Yourself Busy  
The best way to beat addiction? Fill your time with better things. Work, study, read, go to the gym, hang out with friends/family. Keep yourself so busy that bad habits don’t have space to creep in.

8. Stop Feeling Guilty Over Small Progress  
Did you fix your sleep today? Reduced screen time? Read for 10 minutes? That’s progress. Stop overthinking it. Small or big it all counts. Stay consistent, and results will come.

9. Restart, Again and Again.  
Bad habits always find a way to creep back in. That’s normal. But every time you fail, restart. No excuses. No waiting for the “perfect time.” Just start again.
