Purpose of `ping`: To check whether a device can reach another device over a network.

Not “is the website working.” Not “is the server application running.”  

Only this: **Can my machine reach that host at the network level?**

If the answer is **no**, nothing above that layer matters.



## **What Protocol Does `ping` Use?**

`ping` uses **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**.

* **OSI Layer:** Network Layer (Layer 3)
* **TCP/IP Model:** Internet Layer
* **Important:** ICMP is **not TCP** and **not UDP**. It does not carry application data.

Ping sends an **ICMP Echo Request**, and the target replies with an **ICMP Echo Reply**.

Think of it as:

> “Are you alive?” → “Yes, I’m here.”



## **Basic Syntax**

```
ping <target>
```

The target can be:

* A domain name → `google.com`
* An IP address → `8.8.8.8`
* A device on your local network → `192.168.1.1`



## **Example: Pinging a Website**

```
ping google.com
```

Typical output:

```
PING google.com (142.250.183.14) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 142.250.183.14: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=24.3 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.183.14: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=23.8 ms
```

### What just happened?

1. Your system **resolved the domain name**
   `google.com → 142.250.183.14`
   That’s DNS working.

2. Your machine sent ICMP Echo Requests.

3. Google’s server responded.

This confirms:

✔ DNS resolution works
✔ Your network interface works
✔ Routing works
✔ The remote host is reachable
✔ ICMP is not blocked

That’s a lot of information from one command.


## **Ping Also Reveals the IP Address**

Notice:

```
PING google.com (142.250.183.14)
```

Ping quietly tells you the **actual IP address** behind a website. That’s useful for:

* Network diagnostics
* Testing direct IP connectivity
* Understanding how services are hosted



## **Key Output Fields (Don’t Ignore These)**

Example line:

```
64 bytes from 142.250.183.14: icmp_seq=3 ttl=117 time=23.5 ms
```

| Field        | Meaning                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **64 bytes** | Size of reply packet                    |
| **icmp_seq** | Sequence number of packet               |
| **ttl**      | Time To Live — number of hops remaining |
| **time**     | Round-trip latency (milliseconds)       |

### Latency (`time`)

This is how long the packet took to go to the target and back.

* < 1 ms → same machine
* < 5 ms → local network
* 10–50 ms → good internet
* 100+ ms → slow / distant / congested



## **Stopping Ping**

On Linux, `ping` runs **continuously**.

Stop it with:

```
Ctrl + C
```

You’ll then see statistics:

```
--- google.com ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3003ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 23.5/24.0/24.3/0.3 ms
```

### What matters here?

* **packet loss** → If not 0%, your connection is unstable
* **avg** → Average latency

Packet loss is a red flag. Even 2–3% is a problem.



## **Useful Options (Linux)**

### Send only 4 packets

```
ping -c 4 google.com
```

### Change packet size

```
ping -s 1000 google.com
```

### Set interval between packets

```
ping -i 2 google.com
```

### Flood ping (advanced, don’t abuse)

```
ping -f google.com
```

Used for stress testing. Can look like an attack. Use responsibly.



## **Ping on Local Network**

Check if a device in your home network is reachable:

```
ping 192.168.1.10
```

If this fails:

* Device might be off
* Wrong IP
* Firewall blocking ICMP
* Network misconfigured


## **When Ping Fails**

```
Destination Host Unreachable
Request timeout
```

Possible causes:

* No route to host
* Firewall blocking ICMP
* Host powered off
* Wrong IP
* Network cable unplugged
* ISP or router issue

Modern servers often block ICMP intentionally. So:

> Ping failure ≠ host is down,
> It may just be filtered.



## **Why Ping Is Important**

* Fastest network test
* Works on almost every OS and device
* First step in troubleshooting
* Helps isolate whether issue is:

  * Network problem
  * Service problem
  * Application problem

Professionals always start at the lowest layer first. Ping is Layer 3 testing.



## **Manual Help**

To see all options:

```
man ping
```

If you don’t read man pages, you’re limiting yourself.


## **Bottom Line**

`ping` answers one question only:

> **Can I reach that machine over the network?**

It’s simple, but it’s the foundation of practical networking. If you skip mastering basic tools like this and jump to advanced topics, you’ll struggle later.
